order of creation to make a package with devtools and S4: 
1. create class files for Simpson, Trapezoid, and IntegrateIt (these are all .R files written with roxygen2)
2. create development file (here named developPackage.R)
3. use development files to create package - just run the development file in RStudio
4. Know it worked if it generates Rd files and Namespace file etc.
